# Deep Bubble Rises

## Overview
**Deep Bubble Rises** is a 2D endless vertical scrolling game with a mix of 2D and 3D elements. Developed during the **Global Game Jam 2025** using the Unity engine, the game tells the story of a bubble starting its journey at the bottom of the ocean, striving to rise to the surface and see the light of day.

### Core Gameplay
- **Objective:** Help the bubble ascend to the ocean's surface while avoiding obstacles and managing its size and air supply.
- **Challenges:**
  - Avoid fish and coral walls (which act as boundaries).
  - Collect smaller air bubbles to grow larger, but beware—a bigger bubble is harder to maneuver around obstacles.
  - Manage the bubble's air supply, as it deflates over time. Failure to replenish air will result in losing the game.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Size Management:** Collecting smaller bubbles increases the bubble's size, adding a strategic layer. A larger bubble makes dodging obstacles harder, but also prolongs survival.
- **Immersive Visuals:** A vibrant underwater environment combining 2D art with 3D models.
- **Endless Challenge:** The game progressively increases in difficulty as the bubble ascends higher.

### Awards
**Deep Bubble Rises** won the **"Best Gameplay" award** at the Global Game Jam 2025, with the jury consisting of industry experts in gaming, 3D modeling, game journalism, and audio design.
